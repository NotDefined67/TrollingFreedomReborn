## 📝 Roadmap & Known Issues

> [!WARNING]
> **STUFF THAT'S BROKEN / NEEDS ATTENTION:**
> * **World Loading:** Doesn't work correctly; currently using a temporary workaround.
> * **Herobrine:** Some block-related logic fails, causing console warnings I can't currently fix.
> * **Reliability:** Many trolls don't seem to trigger on the first try. Relogging or using `/panicstoptroll` usually fixes this.
> * **Building Glitch:** Dying during specific trolls can sometimes prevent players from placing/breaking blocks until they relog.
