## 🚀 Features

### 🛠️ General
* **Highly Customizable:** Tweak almost every feature via the `config.yml`.
* **Language Support:** Removed Chinese support from original for the sake of my insanity.
* **Safety First:** Includes a **Blocklist** to protect specific players (like Admins) from being trolled.
* **Modernized Code:** Refactored for stability on 1.18 - 1.21.11+.

### 📦 Dependencies
* **ProtocolLib** (Required)
* **EssentialsX** (Useful)
* **SkinRestorer** (Optional, gives better experience on cracked servers)
* **Citizens2** (Required only for the Herobrine troll)

### 🖱️ The Troll Menu
Open the main interface with `/trollgui` to access over 70 unique actions:
* **Classic Trolls:** Herobrine (NPC), Fake Ban, Fake Crash, OP Troll, and TNT Troll.
* **Interactive Trolls:** Control player movement, Inventory See, and Spin.
* **Visual/Audio Pranks:** Ghast Screams, Guardian Hallucinations, Pumpkin Head, and Flash Screen.
* **Chaos:** Nuke Troll, Coffin Dance (with music!), Rocket Launch, and Rain Items.

## 🔧 Maintenance Note
I decided to fork and maintain this when I needed to use it myself. I'll be honest: I don't understand half the things in this plugin! I haven't coded in a long time, so a significant portion of the logic was AI-generated. 

The code is still quite messy—it needs a braver person to fix it properly. Feel free to contribute; credits will be given below.
